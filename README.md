# Spam Detactive 🕵‍♀📩

A simple web-based application to detect spam messages using a Python backend and frontend technologies.

## 📁 Files in this project:
- spamapp.py → Python script for spam detection logic 🧠  
- index.html → Frontend user interface 🌐  
- style.css → Page styling 🎨  
- script.js → JS interactivity and request handling ⚙

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Run the backend:
   ```bash
   python spamapp.py
   Almost perfect broo 🙌 You're super close!

Yes, you can copy-paste that part — but it’s best to copy the full README so your project looks complete and professional 💯

Here’s why:

You’re missing the part that says what tech was used (like HTML, Python, etc)

No "Author" section that gives you credit 💖

People reading your repo won’t know how to open index.html in browser or what the project really does
